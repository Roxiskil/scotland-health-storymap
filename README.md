## What this project shows
This project explores how self-reported health responses are distributed across Scotland’s local authorities using **Census 2022** categories:
- Very good
- Good
- Fair
- Bad
- Very bad

It also highlights counts for selected long-term conditions (e.g., long-term illness, physical disability).  
**Note:** These are **counts**, not rates. Larger councils naturally produce larger numbers, so the next step would be to normalise by population and age structure.
